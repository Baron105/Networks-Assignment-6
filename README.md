## How to run 
Run `make all` to compile the `simDNSServer.c` and simDNSClient.c .
Run the server using `./server` and the client using `./client`.
The server will first ask its own mac address and ip address. This must be provided by the user ( can use `inconfig` command to get the mac address and ip address of the server)
